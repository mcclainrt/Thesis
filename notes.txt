camera cal--- independent of ROS

rename node /usb_cam:=/camera
start image proc in ROS_NAMESPACE=camera (NAMESPACE adds /"NAMESPACE"/___ to each topic)

work on getting camera topic into ros--done, needed driver


^D close tem window
^Q close all?
---------------
needed to install sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev -- for what?
-----------
uvc camera ros pack -- didnt actually use
installed libuvc - from git, mkdir nbuild, cd build, cmake .., make, sudo make install
need v4l-utils

------------------------------------------------------------

camera cal in image_pipeline pack

	rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node
	
	rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.0025 image:=/usb_cam/image_raw camera:=/usb_cam
	
	"size is number of interior corners of board, square is size of single sqaure on board in meters

the calibrate button will freeze video and take a couple seconds (maybe minutes) and then will display cal in terminal. hit commit to create the file in the appropriate .ros/camera_info directory or save and then find it in the /tmp file under root and move it

---------------------------------------------
running without built launch

roscore

rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node /usb_cam:=/camera_rect


to get all required topics published: also may beable to edit so doesnt require camera_rect
ROS_NAMESPACE=camera_rect rosrun image_proc image_proc

rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph

rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view

-------------------------------------------
current launch file

roslaunch apriltags2_ros thesis_tags1

--------------------------------------------

**looks like "size" in the tags.yaml config for apriltags is the size of just the black part not with the 1 bit white border
also, measuring about 3cm off consistently, may change with a larger tag?
running with just the camera to april tags it is more off
with the image rectified through the image pipeline its closer. calibration may play a bigger roll? may need a larger chessboard


to run april tags with raw image, changed the launch file for continuous detection to reflect the right topics for the camera and image

to view the poses: rostopic echo /tag_detections

-----------------------------------------------

patrickelectric git hub for ros package
 
needed pymavlink also

which need to use python and pip 
	https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
	https://github.com/ArduPilot/pymavlink

also needed pyros
	sudo pip install -U pyros /or whatever

need to install mavros too
https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/blob/master/mavros/README.md
needed the geographiclib too

-----------------------------------------------
new path, try to get udp into ros video stream, ros packagae above is not publishing camera topics

downloaded viseo_stream_opencv and created launch file thesistags2 to try and use it, dont know where im going wrong

rtp stream requires sdp file, created the sdp, or tried to, and saved as camera try. Just don't know

! multiudpsink clients=192.168.2.1:5600,192.168.2.1:5601

-----------------------------------------------
using bluerov2_node, the camera raw topic is published but need to modify scripts to publish camera info topic as well

using this method could possibly change the user node to do the same

still want to look into just streaming the video and using groundcontrol?

also if using both need to remember to multisink the camera and change the udp stream the node is using

so, create new python script or update bluerov2_node.py to publish the camera_info topic/ message
if I create my own, could take out all the other stuff and specify 5601 as port and just use video script
and then only publish the topics i want to publish

script would only need to call video.py and publish that image and the camera info, 


------------------------------------------------

launch file apriltags2_ros thesistags_ext uses external logitech camera
with box set up, the lighting is too bright, need to figure out how to adjust the contrast, whitebalance, and or brightness to be able to get rid of the wash out effect

-------------------------------------------------

to bring camera feed from rov using bluerov2 node
roslaunch apriltags2_ros continuous_detection.launch camera_name:=/BlueRov2/camera image_rect:=/image_raw
still need the camera_info to be published

-------------------------------------------------

roslaunch apriltags2_ros continuous_detection.launch camera_name:=/ROVcam image_rect:=/image_raw

finally

rtmcclai@kala:~$ rosrun udpvid pubs2.py 

rate in the node file will change sleep rate, 30-50 is avg

changed script and now vidpublisher is the node to run
will build rospack with vidpublisher, video then a launch file with that and the 



need to make launch file
parameters: udp port, camera info url, ROVcam namespace and matches to apriltags

control c is not killing the node? i think its not throwing the exception that and erroring out 
- i was right, the else pass I had in it never let it break the try:

------------------------------------------------------------

ROV Camera cal using image pipline rospack

rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.0025 image:=/ROVcam/image_raw camera:=/ROVcam --no-service-check

-----------------------

Back lit
Acrylic with vinyl is simplest and most effective so far
filled in acrylic will be just as good
exposure and other settings are crucial, not sure how to auto set that but thats future work
launch fille needs help, needs to launch april tags also. vidpub node isnt updating or refreshing sometimes, not really sure why

-------------------------------------------------------
roslaunch udpvid vidpublisher.launch camera_name:=/ROVcam image_rect:=/image_raw

To work with bag files may need roboticsAddons to use the custom message the AprilTags produces
